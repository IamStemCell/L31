Task 1

Joins

Use the sample SQLite database hr.db (same database you used in the previous lesson for homework tasks)

As a solution to HW, create a file named: task1.sql with all SQL queries:

 

1. write a query in SQL to display the first name, last name, department number, and department name for each employee

2. write a query in SQL to display the first and last name, department, city, and state province for each employee

3. write a query in SQL to display the first name, last name, department number, and department name, for all employees for departments 80 or 40

4. write a query in SQL to display all departments including those where does not have any employee

5. write a query in SQL to display the first name of all employees including the first name of their manager

6. write a query in SQL to display the job title, full name (first and last name ) of the employee, and the difference between the maximum salary for the job and the salary of the employee

7. write a query in SQL to display the job title and the average salary of employees

8. write a query in SQL to display the full name (first and last name), and salary of those employees who work in any department located in London

9. write a query in SQL to display the department name and the number of employees in each department

task1.sql
--1 query
 select e.first_name, e.last_name, e.department_id, d.depart_name FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id=d.department_id;
